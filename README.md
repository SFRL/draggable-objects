# draggable-objects
An example of how to create draggable objects with javascript 

The whole code is contained in index.html, for simplicity it is implemented to run on a laptop/desktop only. But it could easily work on mobile if touch events (in addition to mouse events) are added.

Open the example with [https://sfrl.github.io/draggable-objects/](https://sfrl.github.io/draggable-objects/) to see it in action.
